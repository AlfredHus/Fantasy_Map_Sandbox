Gdscript coding guidelines

Static Typing

Arrays
var some_name: Array[int]

Typed Dictionary Examples
var grid_dictionary: Dictionary[int, Array]
var all_grid_dictionary: Dictionary[int, int]



Ternary expressions
https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html#statements-and-control-flow
var x = (value) if (expression) else (value)
y += 3 if y < 10 else -1

Git Commands to remember
- Use this if I create a repository on GitHub, delete the repository and try to create a new one 
  from git. This deals with the GitHub error when I try to push the new repository 
  "The repository does not seem to exist anymore. You may not have [enter access, or it may 
  have been deleted or renamed"
$ git remote -v
> origin    git@git-server/octocat/hello-world.git (fetch)
> origin    git@git-server/octocat/hello-world.git (push)
# Remove existing remotes
$ git remote remove origin

- Add and commit multiple files
git add . && git commit -m "your message here"
