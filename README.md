# Overview
The Fantasy Map Sandbox is a work in progress (WIP) for me to learn Godot and GDscript. This is being done by creating Fantasy Maps using a variety of techniques. There is alot of usage of other Open Source projects which are listed in the Attributions section of the README.

Since it is a learning project, the code is messy, has alot of code I stopped using and haven't removed yet, code that may raise an eyebrow or two and the whole thing in a constant state of change. I also have alot of inline comments to help me remember things I did and to explain to my future self why I did something.

# Example Screenshots
A couple of screenshots to see examples of the outputs.
